# **Awan's Auto Rigger**

For my college final project, I created an Auto Rigger which can be used with Autodesk Maya to speed up the rigging process for humanoid 3d characters.

*Currently working on the user interface*  
*Rig system is pretty much done so if you want to try it now :*
*   1. Clone, download, or copy the main.py file then open it or paste it in the script editor inside Maya*

*But I really wish you'd wait until I finished all the features and documentation so in the meantime, bear with me ;)*
