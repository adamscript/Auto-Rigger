# **Awan's Auto Rigging Toolkit + Picker GUI**

For my college final project, I created an Auto Rigger which can be used with Autodesk Maya to speed up the rigging process for humanoid 3d characters.

*Currently working on the documentation*  

How to install :
1. Clone/download the zip file
2. Extract it (you can do it wherever you want)

Now you have two options:  
3. Run install.bat (for windows, this file will do the steps below automatically)

or

3. Create a new .mod file, you can name it whatever you want (e.g. awtorigger.mod)
4. Inside that file, type in '+ AwtoRigger 1.0 [your awtorigger full directory]'

e.g.

    > + AwtoRigger 1.0 C:\Users\awwwan\Awan-Auto-Rigger

5. Move the .mod file into one of these directory :

**Default for Windows**
- <user’s directory>/My Documents/Maya/<version>/modules

- <user’s directory>/My Documents/Maya/modules

- C:/Program Files/Common Files/Autodesk Shared/Modules/Maya/<version>

- C:/Program Files/Common Files/Autodesk Shared/Modules/Maya

- <maya_directory>/modules/

**Default for Mac OS X, Linux**
- $MAYA_APP_DIR/Maya/<version>/modules

- $MAYA_APP_DIR/Maya/modules

- /usr/autodesk/modules/Maya/<version>

- /usr/autodesk/modules/Maya

More about this [here] (https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-EnvVar/files/GUID-228CCA33-4AFE-4380-8C3D-18D23F7EAC72-htm.html) and [here](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=__files_GUID_CB76E356_753B_4837_8C5B_3296C14872CA_htm)

After having done all that, launch Maya (or restart Maya if you already had it opened). If you see the menu for "Awto Rigger" on the menu bar, you have successfully installed Awan's Auto Rigging Toolkit + Picker GUI!

*I really wish you'd wait until I finished documentation so in the meantime, bear with me ;)*
